My name is Jonas Buffington, and I'm a computational data science student. This blog is my engineering log, a place to document the process of building complex systems
and share the lessons learned along the way.

This site was born out of a single, challenging project: building a real-time voxel destruction engine from the ground up with the help of generative AI. That project
became a good learning experience, forcing me to move beyond simple prompt engineering and develop a rigorous methodology for using AI as a tool for deep learning, not
just rapid code generation.
